# practice
Here I solved the problem of detecting and classifying vehicles.

I used retraining of the classifier after using a pretrained detector (i.e., combined two models into one), and also retrained the detector with built-in classification.

I used the *MMDetection* and *MMClassification* libraries.

**I collected and prepared all the data myself!**
